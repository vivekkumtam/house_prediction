Introduction:

This project is a machine learning-based solution for predicting house prices using regression models. The dataset, sourced from 'housing.csv', undergoes thorough preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and one-hot encoding of categorical variables. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase provides insights into the relationships between geographical features (latitude, longitude) and the median house value. The script utilizes the scikit-learn library to implement both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models for predictive analysis. The models are trained on a carefully split dataset and evaluated on a separate test set. The provided visualizations, such as scatter plots and heatmaps, aid in understanding the underlying patterns in the data.

Usage:

To use this project for predicting house prices, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) installed.
2. Place your dataset in a CSV file named 'housing.csv' or update the script with the correct file path.
3. Run the script, which will perform data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and train both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models.
4. Evaluate the model performance using metrics like R-squared scores.
5. Utilize the trained models to make predictions on new data for housing price estimation.
